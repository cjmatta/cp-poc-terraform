## AWS AMIs
Currently supporting CentOS 7 AMIs in the following regions (AMI IDs taken from [here](https://wiki.centos.org/Cloud/AWS#head-78d1e3a4e6ba5c5a3847750d88266916ffe69648)):

* ap-northeast-1
* ap-northeast-2
* ap-south-1
* ap-southeast-1
* ap-southeast-2
* ca-central-1
* eu-central-1
* eu-west-1

## Provisioning
Once you have your AWS instances created the next step is to provision the Confluent Platform inside them.

The ```create_ansible_inventory.py``` script is provided to read the terraform state in JSON and convert it to YAML for use by cp-ansible. 

By default we use the private DNS names for the AWS instances which means that you need to run ansible from one of the machines in AWS. 
```
$ terraform output -json | ./create_ansible_inventory.py > hosts.yml
```
sftp hosts.yml to one of the newly created machines, then ssh into that machine and use http://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible from there.

### Running ansible from same place as terraform
NB! if you use the public DNS names the Kafka brokers will be accessible from the internet.

Passing the ```-p``` or ```--public``` flags to ```create_ansible_inventory.py``` causes it to use the public DNS names instead.
```
$ terraform output -json | ./create_ansible_inventory.py -p > hosts.yml
```
When running ansible locally you need to add the public keys of the machines to the ssh known_hosts file
```
$ terraform output -json | ./register_host_keys.py
```
And then in order to actually have ansible use your AWS private key to access the machines remotely use ```ssh-agent```
```
$ ssh-agent bash
bash-3.2$  ssh-add /path/to/your.pem
bash-3.2$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml all.yml
```
